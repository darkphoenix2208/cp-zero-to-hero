## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. The RPG Skill Tree (DAG) 🗺️
*   **Visual Roadmap:** Navigate a directed acyclic graph of CP topics (Binary Search → DP → Graphs).
*   **Progression:** Unlock new nodes by solving prerequisite problems.
*   **Boss Fights:** Clear "Boss Nodes" under time pressure to advance to the next sector.

### 2. The AI Dojo 🥋
*   **Code Surgeon:** Paste your broken code. The AI analyzes it and shows a "Diff View" of fixes without rewriting everything.
*   **Sensei Mode:** Stuck? Ask for a hint. The AI gently nudges you without spoiling the solution.
*   **Judge Watcher:** Real-time polling of Codeforces submissions.

### 3. Algorithm Studio 🎨
*   **Graph-O-Vision:** A CS-Academy style graph editor. Paste edge lists and see a **Static, Stable** force-directed layout.
*   **Array Animator:** Visualize sorting and searching algorithms step-by-step.
*   **Recursion Tree:** See the call stack of Fibonacci/DFS visually.

### 4. Flashback (The Ritual) 🕯️
*   **Spaced Repetition:** The app tracks your "Forgetting Curve".
*   **Daily Review:** You are prompted to re-solve problems 1 day, 3 days, and 1 week after solving them to ensure retention.

### 5. Mock Interviewer 🎙️
*   **Voice Mode:** A comprehensive mock interview simulation using Gemini.
*   **Live Coding:** Speak your thought process while coding in the shared editor.

### 6. Contest Calendar 🏆
*   **Aggregator:** See upcoming rounds from Codeforces, LeetCode, AtCoder, and CodeChef.
*   **Virtual Participation:** "Time Travel" to past contests and simulate them live.
